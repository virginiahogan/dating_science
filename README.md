here's the plan:
go use google custom search api to get top 10 results for an input name:
https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/overview
prob use sinatra

prob use https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/
prob use https://github.com/sferik/twitter

then see if any of those links are from facebook, twitter, linkedin, or github
if any of them are, go to that page & scrape it & get the top 10 most used words, excluding words from the vendor
then output those words to a webpage
